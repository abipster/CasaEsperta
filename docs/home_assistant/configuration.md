# CasaEsperta - Home Assistant - Configuration

My configuration will be based [Frenck's approach](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config) where we'll try to split every file to represent only one specific thing.

The file [configuration.yaml](../../home_assistant/configuration.yaml) is only used to start the system. From the present include, the integrations will be loaded from files located in [integrations](../../home_assistant/integrations) folder. Each file represents an integration.

* ### [Integrations](integrations.md)

* ### [Add-ons](add_ons.md)

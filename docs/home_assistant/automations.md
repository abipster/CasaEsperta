# CasaEsperta - Home Assistant - Automations


## System
* Set theme on start
    
    Changes the theme when Home Assistant starts
* Set fake heat
    
    Sends a MQTT to a fake topic to set the mode of fake climate entities to 'heat', so Google Assistant can read just the temperature of the linked sensor.
